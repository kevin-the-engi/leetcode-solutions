# 684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. 
The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. 
The graph is represented as an array edges of length `n` where `edges[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `aᵢ` and `bᵢ` in the graph.

Return *an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of* `n` *nodes*. 
If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/kevin-the-engi/leetcode-solutions/blob/master/solutions/redundant-connection/examples/reduntant1-2-graph.jpeg)
```
Input: edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
```

**Constraints:**

* `n == edges.length`
* `3 <= n <= 1000`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= aᵢ < bᵢ <= edges.length`
* `aᵢ != bᵢ`
* There are no repeated edges.
* The given graph is connected.
