# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *its maximum depth.*

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10‚Å¥]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
