# 101. Symmetric Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *check whether it is a mirror of itself* (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![image](https://github.com/kevin-the-engi/leetcode-solutions/blob/master/solutions/symmetric-tree/examples/symtree2.jpeg)
```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
* `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
