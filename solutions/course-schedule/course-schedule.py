# Goal: Given a 2D array of prerequisites[i] = [a,b], where b is required to take a, and number numCourses, return whether or not all courses can be finished.
# Directed graph set up. If a cycle is found, then it's not possible to finish all courses.

# create a map of connections for courses
# create a set to track visited
# iterate thru all courses
#     check if course is possible by going through connections
#         if no then return false
# return true

# dfs function (course number)
#     base: if course has been visited, then return false
#     base: if course has no connections, then return true
#     add course to visited
#     iterate thru course connections
#         use recursion to check connections and return false if trigger base
#     return true
